Connect your WordPress site to your N8N AI agent. Professional chat widget with GDPR support, business hours, and full customization.

== Description ==

**BravesChat** is the bridge between your WordPress site and your **N8N** workflows: connect any AI agent you have built with your visitors, without extra code and in minutes.

= Designed for the N8N community =

* **N8N-ready webhook:** Point BravesChat to your workflow URL and start receiving messages instantly. Supports an authentication token in the header (`X-N8N-Auth`) to protect your endpoints.
* **Complete payload on every message:** Each request includes the current message and the user's unique `sessionId` — everything your N8N nodes need to maintain conversation context.
* **Markdown responses:** Your agent's messages are rendered with rich formatting — bold, lists, links, and code — with no extra configuration.
* **Conversation history with CSV export:** Browse all sessions from the WordPress dashboard and export them to your CRM, spreadsheet, or database with one click.

= Production-ready =

* **Three display modes:** Floating widget, full screen, or mixed — global bubble with full screen on specific pages via a Gutenberg block.
* **Dark mode admin panel:** Toggle between light and dark theme. Preference is saved per user and restored without flash.
* **Configurable business hours:** Define when the chat is active and show a custom message outside those hours — ideal if your agent depends on a human in the loop.
* **Built-in GDPR compliance:** Consent banner that blocks the chat until the user accepts. Montserrat font loaded locally, no external requests.
* **Full brand customization:** Colors, texts, position, skin, and display mode — all adjustable without touching code.
* **Reinforced security:** The N8N authentication token travels only on the server — it is never exposed in the page HTML.
* **WooCommerce compatible:** Works in WooCommerce stores without conflicts, enabling conversational assistance throughout the purchase process.

= Session identification with Fingerprinting =

BravesChat generates a unique `sessionId` per visitor based on browser characteristics (SHA-256 hash), without storing personal data. This allows N8N to maintain conversation context even if the user reloads the page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `braveschat` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin from the **Plugins** menu in WordPress.
3. Go to **BravesChat → Settings** and enter your N8N webhook URL.
4. (Optional) Customize colors, texts, and position under **Appearance**.
5. (Optional) Configure the consent banner under **GDPR**.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need an N8N account to use BravesChat? =

Yes. BravesChat acts as the chat widget on your WordPress, but the intelligence and responses are managed by your own N8N workflow. You can use N8N Cloud or your self-hosted instance.

= Does it work with any AI agent in N8N? =

Yes. BravesChat sends the message and the conversation `sessionId` to the webhook URL you configure. The agent can be connected to OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Ollama, or any model your workflow supports — BravesChat imposes no restrictions.

= What data is sent to the webhook on each message? =

Each request includes: the user's message (`chatInput`) and the unique session identifier (`sessionId`). Conversation history is managed by N8N via the `sessionId`.

= Is the conversation history saved in the WordPress database? =

No. The history shown in the admin panel is fetched directly from your N8N data source (e.g., PostgreSQL) via a separate webhook that you configure.

= Can I hide the chat on certain pages? =

Yes. In the Settings section you can specify pages where the widget should not appear.

= Is it compatible with WooCommerce? =

Yes, BravesChat is compatible with WooCommerce and does not generate conflicts with the checkout process or store styles.

= Does the plugin comply with GDPR? =

Yes. You can enable a consent banner that blocks the chat until the user accepts. User fingerprinting does not collect personal data. The Montserrat font is loaded locally, with no requests to Google Fonts.

= Can I use BravesChat without N8N? =

Technically yes: the webhook can point to any HTTP endpoint that returns JSON with the `output` field. However, the plugin is optimized and documented for N8N workflows.

= Is the N8N authentication token secure? =

Yes. The token travels only on the server — it is never exposed in the page HTML or JavaScript. The frontend sends messages to the WordPress AJAX endpoint, which acts as a proxy and adds the token before contacting N8N.

== Screenshots ==

1. Admin panel dark mode — full dark theme with the new toggle.
2. Floating widget on the frontend — Braves skin showing different display behaviors.
3. Appearance — color, position, skin, bubble image, and display mode customization.
4. Conversation history — per-session viewer with chat bubbles and CSV export.
5. Settings — N8N webhook configuration, authentication method, and chat behavior.

== External services ==

= N8N Webhook (user-configured) =

This plugin sends chat messages to an N8N webhook URL configured by the site administrator.

**What data is sent:** The visitor's chat message, conversation history, an anonymous session identifier (fingerprint), and the current page URL.

**When:** On every message sent by a visitor through the chat widget, but only if the administrator has configured a webhook URL.

**Why:** To forward the conversation to the administrator's N8N workflow for AI processing.

The webhook URL, destination server, and all data processing are fully controlled by the site administrator. No data is sent to any Braves-operated server.
